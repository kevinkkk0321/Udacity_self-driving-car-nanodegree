# Behavioral Cloning Project

This project is from [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/), which is the fourth project of the [Self-Driving Car NanoDegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/self-driving-car-engineer-nanodegree--nd013) course.

Overview
---
In this project, you will use what you've learned about deep neural networks and convolutional neural networks to clone driving behavior. You will train, validate and test a model using Keras. The model will output a steering angle to an autonomous vehicle.

The Project
---
The goals / steps of this project are the following:
* Use the simulator to collect data of good driving behavior 
* Design, train and validate a model that predicts a steering angle from image data
* Use the model to drive the vehicle autonomously around the first track in the simulator. The vehicle should remain on the road for an entire loop around the track.
* Summarize the results with a written report

Result
---
Build a mini self driving car which is able to drive by itself inside the lane
